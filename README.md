This project is for educational purposes only and is not intended for use in violation of Discord's Terms of Service (TOS). Creating self-bots, automating user accounts, or using user tokens is against Discord's TOS and can result in the permanent suspension of your account. By using this project, you acknowledge the risks and accept full responsibility for any consequences that may arise. The author(s) and contributors of this project are not responsible for any actions taken by those who use this project.

PS
This program is designed with several safeguards in place to minimize the risk of violating Discord's TOS:

1. The program can only be used on an account owned by the person running the program.
2. The program can only delete messages sent by the specified username, meaning it won't affect and cannot delete other users' messages.
3. The program includes a coded delay of 10 seconds between each message deletion, ensuring that only one message can be deleted every 10 seconds to avoid API rate limits.

These safeguards are intended to ensure that the program is used responsibly and with the understanding that its primary purpose is educational.
